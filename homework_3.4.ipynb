    "Question 1 (1 point): Dummies on Month and Week-of-Month\n",
    "Find the ABSOLUTE CORRELATION VALUE of the most correlated dummy <month-week_of_month> with the binary outcome variable is_positive_growth_5d_future?\n",
    "\n",
    "You saw in the correlation analysis and modeling that September and October may be important seasonal months. In this task, we'll go futher and try to generate dummies for Month and Week-of-month (starting from 1). For example, the first week of October should be coded similar to this: 'October_w1'. Once you've generated the new set of variables, find the most correlated (in absolute value) one with is_positive_growth_5d_future and round it to 3 digits after the comma.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suggested path to a solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "[Source] Use this formula to get the week of month for the datetime variable d: (d.day-1)//7+1\n",
    "Define a new string variable for all month-week_of_month combinations. Append it to the CATEGORICAL features set. You should have 5 variables treated as CATEGORICAL now: 'Month', 'Weekday', 'Ticker', 'ticker_type', 'month_wom'. In the end, you should get 115 dummy features, including 60 (=12*5) week_month_of_week dummies.\n",
    "Use pandas.get_dummies() to generate dummies.\n",
    "Use pandas.DataFrame.corr() function (also used in [Code Snippet 1]) to get correlations with is_positive_growth_5d_future, filter out only variables representing the new dummy set, and sort it by absolute values (you can define a new column \"abs_corr\" in the dataframe with correlations), and find the highest value (among the new dummies features set).\n",
    "NOTE: new dummies will be used as features in the next tasks, please leave them in the dataset."

    "Step1: Rewrite the '1.4.3 Inference for a decision tree' piece for the Decision Tree Classifier with max_depth=10 (clf_10), so that you fit the model on TRAIN+VALIDATION sets (unchanged from the lecture), but predict on the whole set X_all (to be able to define a new column 'pred5_clf_10' in the dataframe new_df). Here is the link with explanation. It will solve the problem in 1.4.5 when predictions were made only for Test dataset and couldn't be easily joined with the full dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step2: Once you have it, define a new column 'only_pred5_is_correct' similar to 'hand' prediction rules with several conditions: is_positive_growth_5d_future AND is_correct_pred5 should be equal 1, while all other predictions is_correct_pred0..is_correct_pred4 should be equal to 0.\n",

    "\n",
    "ADVANCED: define a function that can be applied to the whole row of predictions (a few examples of pandas-apply-row-functions) and can find whether some prediction 'predX' (where X is one of the predictions) is uniquely correct. It should work even if there are 100 predictions available, so that you don't define manually the condition for 'predX'."

Draw a line of precision/accuracy vs. max_depth and note whether there's a saturation point of precision/accuracy as max_depth increases. In theory, there should be a trade-off between better fitting (=more complex trees) and generalization."
